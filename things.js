      "Now I'm typing a bunch of stuff to see what it's going to look like when a bunch of stuff is typed into the box. What I'm hoping for is something that doesn't look too terrible. I wonder now if this is why twitter put a limit on the amount of characters one could input into a tweet. Seems like this should do it. If not I can always type more. Am I right or am I right? We'll see. But I'm right. Here we go. It's not quite as long as I wanted it to be. A curious thing happened when I tried to check it out though. I saved the file and refreshed the page but it wouldn't register the new class. It's like the function won't run until I reset the server but I thought that was the point. Maybe I didn't download nodemon. I'll check it out. I did download it I just didn't run it. For shame. So what was happening with my desktop at home. I'll have to figure out how that happened when I get home.",
